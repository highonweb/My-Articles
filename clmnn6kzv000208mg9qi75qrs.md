Hey, carbon-based lifeforms, wait that's probably some kind of politically incorrect statement in the not-so-distant future when we are ruled by our AI overlords, so hey whoever can comprehend this I am gonna call you readers from now on. I am Mohan A Software Engineer by day and a philosophy enthusiast by night. This blog is going to be the travelogue of my journey through the challenging but exciting field of software engineering, philosophy, books in general and maybe a little bit of a blend of both.

### Why you may ask?

So, just yesterday, I celebrated my one-month anniversary since I joined as a software engineer. It's been quite a journey because I've been into programming and development since my early engineering years. One thing that really bothers me is when people get overly passionate about a particular programming language or technology and end up personally attacking others who have different preferences. That's just not my style, and I've made a conscious decision not to become one of those individuals.

My goal is to become a language-agnostic developer, someone who understands various programming paradigms and languages and uses them appropriately for different tasks. However, when I look at the career path ahead, it seems like I might be predominantly working with Java or other JVM languages. This realization has triggered a fear in me - the fear of becoming exactly the type of person I dislike in these heated technology debates.

I've always believed in the principle of continuous learning in my life. But I'm concerned that after working in my software engineering job for about 3-6 months, I might hit a plateau where I won't be learning as many new things as I'd like.

I love to read books and love to discuss them much more but being stuck in a remote job I can't do that, So looking forward to your POVs in my pieces about books

That's why I've decided to start this blog hoping to learn a lot of new technical principles, technologies and everything tech where I hope to document my experiences and share the valuable lessons I learn along the way.

### What's on the horizon?

In the coming months, I have an exciting lineup of topics that I plan to delve into on this blog. I'll be diving deep into technical principles, new technologies, programming paradigms, and other exciting tech topics. This means breaking down complex concepts in software engineering and technology into easily digestible pieces. I'll try to keep the content less language-specific even if it tends to be I aim to give ample background and context.

In addition to technical topics, As an avid reader and philosophy enthusiast, I believe that literature and philosophy can enrich our lives in profound ways. I'll be diving into the world of books, sharing reviews, and thought-provoking insights from the books I read.

Thanks for reading
